# Graph-function-to-plot-numerical-and-categorical-variable
#Import matplotlib,seaborn to plot histogram,barplot and boxplot
#Import os 
# Import pandas for loading the dataset
# use definition function and pass data in form of csv ,coloum=none and directory =None
# If directory is none call os.directory to call the directory else pass directory to os.chdir
# Read the data using pandas
# Make a directory 
# When column is not specified by user Plot Box plot and histogram for numerical data and bar plot for categorical data(limit it to 30 show graph neatly)
# When column is specified by user Plot Box plot and histogram for numerical data and bar plot for categorical data(limit it to 30 show graph neatly).
#plt function is used plotting graph and to store it computer use savefig.
# Plot the heatmap as Heat Maps is Used to better visualize the data using seaborn
