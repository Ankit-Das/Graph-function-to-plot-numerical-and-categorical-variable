# Import matplotlib,seaborn to plot histogram,barplot and boxplot
Import os 
Import pandas for loading the dataset
Use definition function and pass data in form of csv ,coloum=none and directory =None
If directory is none call os.directory to call the directory else pass directory to os.chdir

When column is not specified by user Plot Box plot and histogram for numerical data and bar plot for categorical data(limit it to 30 show graph neatly for categorical)
When column is specified by user Plot Box plot and histogram for numerical data and bar plot for categorical data(limit it to 30 show        graph neatly for categorical).

Plot the heatmap as Heat Maps is Used to better visualize the data using seaborn 
Save the file as .py and call the file in new jupyter notebook as for real time data analysis we can't write every piece of code in one   file we create code in different files and call it in a single file for code readability.
